## Card Interpretations

### Past: The Empress (Upright)

Your past is rooted in nurturing, caretaking, and consistent personal growth:  all hallmarks of The Empress. In your teaching career, you likely found fulfillment and alignment with your sense of purpose, especially in the earlier years. There was emotional richness here, and the work fed something real in you.

The Empress also speaks to abundance and cycles of growth. You’ve seen the fruits of your labor, helped others grow, and become deeply attuned to your own capacities. And yet...the Empress sits still. Her kingdom is lush, but her role is established. You may feel yourself entering a new season, where the role that once gave so much now feels repetitive or surface-level.

It’s also worth asking: was this path one you chose, or one that felt “natural” because of external expectations? For many women, teaching is seen as a nurturing, socially acceptable career, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only way to live out those gifts.

The Empress thrives in fertile, familiar ground, but all cycles of harvest must eventually turn toward renewal. Are you tending the same garden because it still feeds you, or simply because it’s the one you’ve always known?

### Present: Two of Cups (Reversed)

Currently, you may feel disconnected -- from others, from your work, or even from yourself. Something isn’t quite clicking anymore. This card reversed often signals misalignment and emotional dissonance, as if your inner world and outer role are no longer syncing up.

There may be communication issues or relationship tension at work. Maybe you feel frustrated with class sizes, bureaucratic limits, or an inability to connect with students one-on-one. Or perhaps the tension is internal, a private reckoning that your current job no longer reflects who you are becoming.

The Two of Cups is often about partnership. When reversed, it asks: are you still in partnership with your own values? Your own joy?

The person you’ve become may be outgrowing the role you once stepped into. That dissonance can show up as burnout, confusion, or disillusionment, even when nothing is technically wrong.

### Future: Five of Cups (Reversed)

Upright, this card is about grief, loss, and regret. But reversed, the Five of Cups offers something quieter, but more profound: release. Healing. Moving forward. This is the card of acceptance after sorrow -- not in a dramatic, revelatory way, but in a slow exhale.

You may carry old regrets about the career you didn’t pursue, or about the time spent in something that doesn’t fulfill you anymore. But this card says: those regrets won’t define you. You will find peace with your past and feel empowered to choose a future based on who you are now.

The Five of Cups reversed doesn’t erase the past. It shows you how to carry it differently. You’ll no longer be defined by what might have been, but by what you choose.

## Emerging Themes and Energy Patterns

- The Empress (Major Arcana) → Cups (Minor Arcana): You’re moving from a completed life chapter into an emotionally uncertain new phase. But this an evolution, not a regression. The Empress reflects a full cycle. Now, the 2 and 5 of Cups suggest you’re back at the beginning of a new emotional arc.
- Cups Reversed (Present and Future): There’s emotional turbulence in this decision...possibly confusion, self-doubt, and inner conflict. That’s okay. You’re emotionally unmoored right now, but not lost. You’re figuring out how to bring your next identity into alignment.
- Two Paths of Nurturing: Both teaching and therapy are roles of service and care. One involves collective cultivation (classroom), the other intimate cultivation (individual healing). This isn’t about right or wrong. It’s about how you want to show up in others’ lives going forward.
- Unfinished Dreams: The pull toward therapy may be about reconnecting with something long-buried. It could be a dream, a sense of purpose, or a part of your identity that didn’t get a chance to flourish earlier.

## Synthesis

You’ve built something meaningful and strong, but something inside you is shifting. The Empress in your past confirms that you’ve already become someone powerful and whole. Now the question is: how will you live out that wholeness?

There’s no guarantee that the next chapter will be easy, but the cards suggest that it will be healing. Therapy may offer you the one-on-one depth you’ve longed for, and the emotional clarity you’ve been missing. More importantly, it will allow you to move forward -- not to escape your past, but to carry it differently.

## Guidance

Don't ask yourself, "Am I ready?" Ask yourself, "What kind of nurturer do I want to be next?" You already have all the gifts. Now it's just about choosing the form to express them. Whatever you choose, you'll finally be choosing *for yourself.*
