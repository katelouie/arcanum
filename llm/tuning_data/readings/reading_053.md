## Card Interpretations

### Past: The Lovers (Reversed)

Oh boy. Let’s just start here: you’ve been in situationships (or full-blown relationships) where "choice" wasn’t really a choice. You weren’t picking partners. You were trying to fix something, or fill something, or prove that you could finally make it work with someone who clearly didn’t deserve you. This card reversed in the past says your love life has been less "divine union" and more "why did I ignore all 73 red flags and that flashing neon sign that said RUN?" You keep choosing chaos like it’s your *thing*. (No judgment if it is, but like… maybe aim for the functional kind next time?)

### Present: Nine of Wands (Upright)

Here’s where you are now: burnt-out, a little crispy, but still standing. You’ve been through some emotional nonsense, and you’re lowkey traumatized. This is the card of someone who knows better now...but who’s also tired of knowing better. You’ve got your walls up so high that even decent people would need climbing gear to reach you. You’re wounded, suspicious, and watching everyone with one eye squinted like, "I dare you to mess with me." And while that’s understandable, it’s also exhausting. Trust issues are justified, but they also isolate you. You’re in "I don’t trust anybody but my group chat" mode, and it shows.

### Future: Three of Swords (Upright)

Ooof. Okay. Deep breath. This card is nobody’s favorite, but it’s also not the death sentence people think it is. This is heartbreak, but it’s honest heartbreak. No illusions. No pretending someone was "the one" when they treated you like a backup plan. What this tells me is: your future holds a confrontation with a truth about love that hurts -- but heals. Something is going to break open so you can finally see the pattern. And that break sets you free. The pain is the exit wound for the lies you’ve been carrying around about what you deserve.

## Emerging Themes and Patterns

This is a classic trilogy: 

Bad choices (Lovers Rx) -> Emotional burnout (9 of Wands) -> Heartbreak that wakes you up (3 of Swords).

All three cards are intense, and none of them are passive. You’re actively in a cycle, whether you know it or not.
You’ve been choosing lovers like they’re self-improvement projects. Your intuition is like, "NO," and you’re like "but maybe if I just—" No. This spread is basically yelling, "STOP PICKING PEOPLE WHO CONFIRM YOUR WORST FEARS ABOUT YOURSELF."

Also. All three cards point to isolation. You’re carrying the load alone, in your head, behind emotional barbed wire. That needs to change.

## Synthesis

Here’s the deal: this isn’t about them. It never was. It’s about you thinking you need to earn love by surviving it. You’ve confused emotional endurance with affection. You’ve been choosing people who don’t see you because you weren’t seeing you either.

But now, you’re on the edge of the realization. You’re seeing the patterns. You’re getting tired of bleeding for connections that don’t even offer a damn bandage. And that’s good. Because the moment you get tired of your own excuses is the moment everything changes.

## Guidance

- Let it hurt. Then let it teach you. Stop fighting to stay in other people’s stories when you should be writing your own.
- Next time you feel that old familiar flutter of "this is exciting!" ask yourself, is this excitement or just anxiety in a trench coat?
- Stop giving people applications to your heart who clearly can’t hold scissors safely.
- You want different? Choose different. Start by choosing you.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

(Or to journal if that's your thing)

- What do I mistake for chemistry?
- What would it feel like to be safe in love?
- What pattern am I finally ready to break?
