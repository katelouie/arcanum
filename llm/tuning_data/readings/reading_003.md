Spread: Single Card

Question: I keep attracting partners who are emotionally unavailable. What pattern am I missing?

Cards Drawn:

- Focus: Seven of Wands (Upright)

---

## Interpretation

The Seven of Wands says: "You’re not afraid of a challenge. But are you choosing the right ones?"

This card suggests you’ve been drawn, time and again, to emotionally unavailable partners. This is not because you consciously want heartache, but because something about their resistance appeals to you. There’s a fight in this card, a sense of defending your position, proving yourself, and pushing uphill. That same energy may be showing up in your relationships: you’re attracted to people who make you earn it.

The issue isn’t your loyalty or your persistence. Those are strengths. But ask yourself: is this really a connection, or just a battle you’ve convinced yourself is worth winning?

The people you’re drawn to might be guarded, distant, or hard to reach. They're not cruel, they’re protecting themselves. They may associate vulnerability with weakness, and see love as something to fend off until it’s "deserved." That might mirror something in you: a hesitancy to open up fully unless the other person has proven they won’t leave. In that case, chasing emotionally closed-off partners is safer than facing your own fears of being truly seen.

You might be reenacting a pattern that feels noble: "I can prove I’m worthy, I’ll win them over, I’ll hold the line no matter what". In reality, that fight might be draining you more than it’s serving you.

## Correspondences

- **Element: Fire.** Fire is active, passionate, driven. Here, it suggests your relationships often involve a fight for attention or affection. You feel like you need to assert yourself to even be seen.
- **Cardinality: Fixed.** The fixed nature of this card reflects stubborn persistence. You may feel it’s your duty to hold on even when others pull away, or prove your worth through emotional endurance.
- **Leo Decan 3 (Mars Rulership).** This is pride-driven fire. Loyalty, defense, and honor matter deeply to you. But Mars here can turn love into war and make conquest feel like intimacy. This decan asks: are you fighting for love, or just fighting?

## Symbology

In the card image, the figure stands above the others, holding his ground against unseen opponents. He fights alone, defending his position.

That position might be a belief like:

- "If I’m strong and persistent enough, they’ll eventually open up."
- "I just need to prove I’m different than the others."

But the battle might be self-imposed. Sometimes you’re the one on the other side of the wand: testing others with your own walls, drawn to people who won’t challenge them.

The opposition may not be external partners at all. It might be you, wrestling with the part of yourself that believes love has to be earned, proven, or fought for.

## Takeaway

You are powerful, passionate, and persistent. But you’re not obligated to keep throwing yourself into relationships that only reward your resilience.

You’re allowed to seek ease. You’re allowed to want emotional safety. And you don’t have to "win" love through effort. You can receive it freely, without struggle.

## Suggestions

- Reexamine your beliefs about effort in love. If it doesn’t feel hard, do you unconsciously devalue it?
- Identify patterns of pride and proving. Do you feel like you need to earn someone’s love or change their mind about you?
- Ask yourself honestly: What does "emotionally available" look like to you? And are you making space for that version of connection, or only for the ones that require fighting for scraps?
- Try detaching worth from difficulty. A peaceful relationship doesn’t mean it’s boring. It means you’re finally allowed to rest.
