What's really blocking me?\n\nCards Drawn:\n\n- Focus: The Magician (Reversed)\n\n---\n\n## Interpretation\n\nThe Magician says: The channel is present but the current's not flowing.\n\nWhen the Magician is reversed, all of the will and power that normally flows forth from this card is instead **held in check** -- like a disconnected wire. Your problem isn't due to lack of talent or potential (you're overflowing). Instead, what's happening right now is more subtle: your energy is diffused and unfocused, and your belief in your own self and your voice is wavering.\n\nYou might be feeling like you've lost control, or you're stuck in a holding pattern. This could especially be due to mental interference -- whether that's self-sabotage and doubt, or external voices and forces wearing you down and emptying you out. The Magician is ruled by Mercury, which governs the mind, language and intention -- so the blockage is likely coming from one of those areas. There's a good chance that you're tripping yourself up before you ever put pen to paper or brush to canvas. This is the card of overthinking, undertrusting and self-doubt swirling in your head.\n\nYour creativity and talent is all still there. So is your inspiration. You've just had your connection to it be temporarily shut down, like someone or something has clipped your wings. The Magician reversed says that you need to repair that channel via mental clarity and dispelling the fog you're lost in.\n\n## Correspondences\n\n- **Planet: Mercury.** This symbolizes thought, intention, and focus. When it's reversed -- or stuck in its shadow-self -- this strength loops back on itself, leading to doubt and analysis paralysis.\n- **Element: Air.** This element symbolizes thought, mental flow and a wellspring of agile ideation. Reversed, the air is stagnant -- it has nowhere to go and is getting staler by the minute. Without something to ground your mental processes or force you to take action, you're just going around in circles.\n\n## Symbology\n\nThe Magician normally stands with one hand raised to the heavens and the other pointing to the earth, channeling divine inspiration into the material world. His tools (wand, sword, cup, pentacle) represent mastery over all four elements, the raw ingredients of creation.\n\nBut reversed, that channel gets disrupted. You still have all the tools, but they lie dormant. This can signal a variety of things.\n\n- A fear that you\u2019re not \"good enough\" to use them.\n- A hesitancy to commit to any one direction.\n- A disconnection between your vision and your action.\n\nIt\u2019s like having a beautiful idea, but your inner voice interrupts every time you try to write it down.\n\n## Takeaway\n\nYou haven't lost anything. Your creativity, your inspiration, your mental acuity -- those are all inherent to you. You've just lost your connection to them. It's the signal that's faulty, not you. That current can flow again, but you have to **believe in your own right to wield it.**\n\n## Suggestions\n\n- Clear your mental clutter.\n- Work through the fog. Focus on one small piece at a time. Let yourself be fragmented and messy. Embrace the rough draft.\n- Let go of perfectionism. The things you create don't have to be perfect. They just have to *exist.* Perfect is the enemy of good, and the archenemy of *actually making something that works.*\n- Reclaim your creative autonomy. You don't need permission to create. You don't have to guarantee a specific result. Just begin.\n",
