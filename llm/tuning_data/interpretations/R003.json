What pattern am I missing?\n\nCards Drawn:\n\n- Focus: Seven of Wands (Upright)\n\n---\n\n## Interpretation\n\nThe Seven of Wands says: \"You\u2019re not afraid of a challenge. But are you choosing the right ones?\"\n\nThis card suggests you\u2019ve been drawn, time and again, to emotionally unavailable partners. This is not because you consciously want heartache, but because something about their resistance appeals to you. There\u2019s a fight in this card, a sense of defending your position, proving yourself, and pushing uphill. That same energy may be showing up in your relationships: you\u2019re attracted to people who make you earn it.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t your loyalty or your persistence. Those are strengths. But ask yourself: is this really a connection, or just a battle you\u2019ve convinced yourself is worth winning?\n\nThe people you\u2019re drawn to might be guarded, distant, or hard to reach. They're not cruel, they\u2019re protecting themselves. They may associate vulnerability with weakness, and see love as something to fend off until it\u2019s \"deserved.\" That might mirror something in you: a hesitancy to open up fully unless the other person has proven they won\u2019t leave. In that case, chasing emotionally closed-off partners is safer than facing your own fears of being truly seen.\n\nYou might be reenacting a pattern that feels noble: \"I can prove I\u2019m worthy, I\u2019ll win them over, I\u2019ll hold the line no matter what\". In reality, that fight might be draining you more than it\u2019s serving you.\n\n## Correspondences\n\n- **Element: Fire.** Fire is active, passionate, driven. Here, it suggests your relationships often involve a fight for attention or affection. You feel like you need to assert yourself to even be seen.\n- **Cardinality: Fixed.** The fixed nature of this card reflects stubborn persistence. You may feel it\u2019s your duty to hold on even when others pull away, or prove your worth through emotional endurance.\n- **Leo Decan 3 (Mars Rulership).** This is pride-driven fire. Loyalty, defense, and honor matter deeply to you. But Mars here can turn love into war and make conquest feel like intimacy. This decan asks: are you fighting for love, or just fighting?\n\n## Symbology\n\nIn the card image, the figure stands above the others, holding his ground against unseen opponents. He fights alone, defending his position.\n\nThat position might be a belief like:\n\n- \"If I\u2019m strong and persistent enough, they\u2019ll eventually open up.\"\n- \"I just need to prove I\u2019m different than the others.\"\n\nBut the battle might be self-imposed. Sometimes you\u2019re the one on the other side of the wand: testing others with your own walls, drawn to people who won\u2019t challenge them.\n\nThe opposition may not be external partners at all. It might be you, wrestling with the part of yourself that believes love has to be earned, proven, or fought for.\n\n## Takeaway\n\nYou are powerful, passionate, and persistent. But you\u2019re not obligated to keep throwing yourself into relationships that only reward your resilience.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to seek ease. You\u2019re allowed to want emotional safety. And you don\u2019t have to \"win\" love through effort. You can receive it freely, without struggle.\n\n## Suggestions\n\n- Reexamine your beliefs about effort in love. If it doesn\u2019t feel hard, do you unconsciously devalue it?\n- Identify patterns of pride and proving. Do you feel like you need to earn someone\u2019s love or change their mind about you?\n- Ask yourself honestly: What does \"emotionally available\" look like to you? And are you making space for that version of connection, or only for the ones that require fighting for scraps?\n- Try detaching worth from difficulty. A peaceful relationship doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s boring. It means you\u2019re finally allowed to rest.\n",
