# Tapping to Set the Seed

Perfect! Since you already have the shuffle-and-spread infrastructure, you just need the rhythm-to-seed conversion piece.

**Basic approach:**

```python
import time
import hashlib

def capture_rhythm():
    print("Tap spacebar to your rhythm. Press 'q' when done.")
    timestamps = []

    while True:
        key = input()  # Or use keyboard library for real-time
        if key.lower() == 'q':
            break
        timestamps.append(time.time())

    # Convert to intervals
    intervals = [timestamps[i+1] - timestamps[i] for i in range(len(timestamps)-1)]
    return intervals

def rhythm_to_seed(intervals):
    # Convert intervals to string (rounded to avoid floating point issues)
    interval_str = '_'.join([str(round(interval, 3)) for interval in intervals])

    # Hash to get consistent seed
    hash_obj = hashlib.md5(interval_str.encode())
    seed = int(hash_obj.hexdigest()[:8], 16)  # Use first 8 hex chars as seed

    return seed
```

**For better UX, use `keyboard` library:**

```python
import keyboard
import time

def capture_rhythm_realtime():
    print("Tap spacebar to your rhythm. Press ESC when done.")
    timestamps = []

    def on_space():
        timestamps.append(time.time())

    keyboard.on_press_key('space', lambda _: on_space())
    keyboard.wait('esc')

    intervals = [timestamps[i+1] - timestamps[i] for i in range(len(timestamps)-1)]
    return intervals
```

**Integration with your existing package:**

```python
def rhythm_reading(spread_type="three_card"):
    intervals = capture_rhythm_realtime()
    seed = rhythm_to_seed(intervals)

    # Use your existing shuffle logic
    return your_spread_function(seed=seed, spread=spread_type)
```

**Nice touches:**

- Show their rhythm pattern back to them: `"Your rhythm: 0.5s - 0.8s - 0.3s - 1.2s"`
- Maybe normalize very long pauses to prevent accidentally huge seeds
- Could add minimum/maximum number of taps (like 3-10)

Does this fit with how your existing package is structured?
